# LMI-GREATICE
Contains the source code of LMI GREAT ICE project. This is a Management System for Glacier Monitoring Data.
This app allows to save glaciological, hydrological and meteorological data in CSV files that meet a document format established previously. Also, this app can manage data and 
generate graphics, so the user can visualize temporal lines.

The web application was coded using ASP.NET MVC5. The database was builded using SQL and, database-app interaction uses Entity Framework ORM.
Also, in the Views of the webapp, I used HMTL5, jQuery and CSS.
